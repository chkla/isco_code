5,0,Krankenschwester,no,Krankenschwester,3221,Krankenpflegerin,0.95,"""Krankenschwester"" is the traditional term for a female nurse in German. ""Krankenpflegerin"" (female nurse) under ISCO code 3221 is directly synonymous with ""Krankenschwester."" The similarity score is the highest (75.1%), making this the closest and most appropriate match.",3221,Krankenpfleger,0.85,"""Krankenpfleger"" is the male equivalent to ""Krankenschwester."" Given modern trends toward gender-neutral job titles and the significant similarity score (62.9%), this job title is frequently used interchangeably in professional contexts and is a highly relevant alternative.",3221,Gesundheits- und Krankenpflegerin,0.75,"This updated and more formal job title reflects the newer designation in nursing professions in Germany, merging general and hospital nursing roles (""Gesundheits- und Krankenpflegerin"" - female nurse for health and illness). The similarity (54.8%) and updated nature of the term make it a suitable, though slightly less direct, match for ""Krankenschwester."""
6,1,Kinderbetreuerin,yes,Kinderbetreuerin,5311,Kinderbetreuer,0.95,"The job description ""Kinderbetreuerin"" is the direct feminine form of ""Kinderbetreuer,"" and the ISCO code 5311 matches both the title and the function most closely (Similarity: 85.9%). The match in both duties and terminology justifies the highest confidence level.",3221,Kinderpflegerin,0.75,"""Kinderpflegerin"" also refers to a female childcare worker, with a strong overlap in duties involving child care, albeit with potentially more focus on health and care aspects. The similarity score supports this as the second-closest match.",3412,Erzieherin,0.55,"""Erzieherin"" refers to an educator in childcare settings; while often more qualified, the occupational field overlaps with that of a ""Kinderbetreuerin."" As per the similarity score (58.1%), it is a plausible third choice despite the broader responsibilities associated with ""Erzieherin."""

This is a direct match, and therefore, I have full confidence that this is the most appropriate job title.",2635,Sozialarbeiterin,0.85,"The second most similar title is ""Sozialarbeiterin"" (isco: 2635, occupation: Sozialarbeiterin, Similarity: 78.4%). This is the female form of ""Sozialarbeiter."" While they are essentially the same occupation, the gendered form may be relevant in some contexts. The high similarity and identical ISCO code further support this choice, though the confidence is slightly lower due to the gender distinction.",3412,SOZIALARBEITER,0.7,"The third entry, ""SOZIALARBEITER"" (isco: 3412), although with a different ISCO code, still refers clearly to the same occupational group. The similarity score is 69.2%, making it a reasonably relevant option. However, the difference in ISCO suggests differences in classification or perhaps in job scope or specialty, so confidence is somewhat lower."
22,1,Sozialarbeiterin,yes,Sozialarbeiterin,2635,Sozialarbeiterin,1.0,"The job description to classify exactly matches ""Sozialarbeiterin."" This is the direct and precise job title for the role described, as confirmed by the context with 100% similarity. Therefore, this selection has the highest confidence.",2635,Sozialarbeiter,0.9,"""Sozialarbeiter"" is the gender-neutral or masculine form of ""Sozialarbeiterin."" Since this is essentially the same profession with only a gender distinction (the roles and tasks are identical), it is highly suitable, though slightly less precise given the original description specifies the feminine form.",2635,Sozialpädagogin,0.7,"""Sozialpädagogin"" (female social pedagogue) is highly related and shares core functions with Sozialarbeiterin, especially in fields relating to social work and education. While not an exact match, the overlapping duties and settings make this a reasonable alternative where occupational boundaries are fluid. However, it's less exact than the first two selections."

Based on both the precise job title and ISCO code correspondence, this is the most appropriate and highest-confidence match.",3118,Bauzeichner,0.95,"""Bauzeichner"" is the generic (masculine/gender-neutral) form for the same occupation as ""Bauzeichnerin"" (feminine form). The similarity score is very high (88.7%), and occupational content is identical; hence, it's an almost equally appropriate match.",3118,BAUZEICHNER,0.9,"Although written in uppercase, ""BAUZEICHNER"" refers to the same occupation. The context gives it a somewhat lower similarity score (53.8%)—possibly due to formatting—but it still clearly denotes the same profession. It's appropriate as a third-best match given the limited choice."
53,1,Apothekerin,yes,Apothekerin,2262,Apothekerin,1.0,"The job description to classify is ""Apothekerin,"" which is an exact match with the first occupation listed in the context. This ensures the highest level of confidence, since both gender and title match perfectly.",2262,Apotheker,0.9,"""Apotheker"" is the gender-neutral or masculine form and is commonly used as a general job title.

With a high similarity score of 78.5% in the context and the structural equivalence of job responsibilities, this is a very suitable alternative title.",2635,Sozialpädagogin,0.75,"""Sozialpädagogin"" (female social pedagogue) is closely related to ""Sozialarbeiterin"". While this role may focus more on educational and developmental support within the social field, it often overlaps significantly with social work tasks. The context shows a high similarity (69.8%), justifying its inclusion as the third-best match, though with slightly less confidence due to possible differences in professional focus."
67,0,Physiotherapeutin,no,Physiotherapeutin,2264,Physiotherapeut,0.98,"The term ""Physiotherapeutin"" is the female form of ""Physiotherapeut,"" and the most similar job description (77.6% similarity) directly matches this term under ISCO code 2264.

It appropriately covers the occupation in a gender-neutral/plural sense.",2264,PHYSIOTHERAPEUT,0.85,"""PHYSIOTHERAPEUT"" is just the capitalized form but still refers to the same profession.

Since it is essentially the same occupation, just formatted differently, this is still highly relevant, though a bit less confident than the perfect match.",2100,Ingenieurin,0.7,"The third most similar entry is ""Ingenieurin"" (female form of Ingenieur) with a similarity score of 55.9%. As gender forms are sometimes used interchangeably or inclusively in job classifications, this term is also highly appropriate, though with somewhat less confidence than the other two due to the gender distinction."
85,1,MFA,yes,Medizinische Fachangestellte,3256,Medizinische Fachangestellte,1.0,"This is an exact match with the job description provided (""Medizinische Fachangestellte"").
