5;no;Krankenschwester;3221;Krankenpflegerin;0.90;"""Krankenschwester"" is the traditional (and still widely used) German term for a registered nurse, especially referring to female nurses. The job title ""Krankenpflegerin"" reflects the modern, gender-specific but still equivalent term with highest similarity (75.1%), indicating both job descriptions essentially refer to the same profession.";3221;Krankenpfleger;0.80;"""Krankenpfleger"" is the male counterpart to ""Krankenschwester,"" and is frequently used in gender-neutral contexts as well. With a strong similarity (62.9%), it accurately captures the same professional nursing role as ""Krankenschwester,"" and is often used interchangeably in job classification.";3221;Gesundheits- und Krankenpflegerin;0.65;"This is the formalized, modern job title introduced in Germany for registered nurses, replacing ""Krankenschwester"" in official contexts. Although the similarity (54.8%) is lower than the first two, it denotes the same professional scope and responsibilities as ""Krankenschwester,"" thus making it an appropriate match."
6;yes;Kinderbetreuerin;5311;Kinderbetreuer;0.95;"The term ""Kinderbetreuerin"" is the direct feminine form of ""Kinderbetreuer."" The similarity score is extremely high (85.9%), indicating an almost exact match in job content and duties. Both describe a person responsible for supervising and caring for children, not necessarily with an extensive pedagogical background. This is the most accurate and gender-neutral official job title.";3221;Kinderpflegerin;0.8;"""Kinderpflegerin"" is closely related to the role, often used for professionals involved in childcare but with a focus on more basic care and possibly medical tasks. The similarity is substantial (71.1%), and this title sometimes overlaps with ""Kinderbetreuerin"" in less formal contexts, especially in Germany.";3412;Erzieherin;0.6;"Although ""Erzieherin"" usually designates a person with pedagogical training (early childhood educator), the duties sometimes overlap with those of ""Kinderbetreuerin"" in daycares and similar settings. The similarity score (58.1%) is moderate but justifies its selection as the third-best match, particularly in environments where educational aspects are emphasized in childcare roles."
15;yes;Sozialarbeiter;2635;Sozialarbeiter;1;"The job description provided matches exactly with the title ""Sozialarbeiter"". The highest similarity (100%) and ISCO code correspondence further confirm that this is the primary and most accurate job title for the description.";2635;Sozialarbeiterin;0.85;"""Sozialarbeiterin"" is simply the feminine form of ""Sozialarbeiter"" and is very closely related, with a high similarity score (78.4%). Given the job description is gender neutral, this is an appropriate and highly suitable alternative.";2635;Sozialpädagoge;0.7;"""Sozialpädagoge"" falls under the same ISCO code (2635) and shares many functions and responsibilities with ""Sozialarbeiter"". The similarity score (64.1%) indicates related duties, making it the third most suitable choice for this job description."
22;yes;Sozialarbeiterin;2635;Sozialarbeiterin;1.0;"The job description exactly matches the title ""Sozialarbeiterin"" with a 100% similarity score, making it the most direct and appropriate classification for the given role.";2635;Sozialarbeiter;0.85;"""Sozialarbeiter"" is the male or generic form of ""Sozialarbeiterin."" Given the high similarity (78.5%), it is a suitable alternative title, particularly for systems or contexts where gender differentiation is not specified.";2635;Sozialpädagogin;0.70;"""Sozialpädagogin,"" while not exactly the same, is closely related and often overlaps in job responsibilities with ""Sozialarbeiterin"" (similarity: 69.8%). Therefore, it is an appropriate third option, particularly in settings where social work and social pedagogy are combined or considered interchangeable."
26;no;Bauzeichnerin;3118;Bauzeichnerin;1.0;"""Bauzeichnerin"" is an exact match to the given job description and matches the first entry in the context with 100% similarity. This is clearly the most appropriate job title.";3118;Bauzeichner;0.95;"""Bauzeichner"" is the masculine/general form of ""Bauzeichnerin"" and refers to the same occupation. The context shows a very high similarity (88.7%) and the job tasks are identical aside from gender-specific language differences.";3118;BAUZEICHNER;0.87;"This is the uppercase version of ""Bauzeichner"", which may be used in some official or database contexts and refers to the same occupation, as indicated in the context (53.8% similarity). Although the similarity score is lower, this title still matches the described job."
53;yes;Apothekerin;2262;Apothekerin;1.0;"The job description to classify is ""Apothekerin,"" which is an exact match to both the term and the context’s most similar occupation (#1). This direct correspondence assures the highest confidence that this is the correct job title.";2262;Apotheker;0.9;"""Apotheker"" is the masculine or generic term for ""Apothekerin"" and refers to the same profession. It appears in the similarity list with a high score, indicating it is a very suitable and widely-used occupational title for the described role.";2262;Pharmazeut;0.7;"""Pharmazeut"" is a broader term encompassing individuals trained in pharmacy. While not as specific as ""Apothekerin,"" it still reasonably matches the professional domain and appears in the context as a similar occupation, albeit with a lower similarity score. It is selected to ensure three distinct yet relevant titles are provided."
57;yes;Sozialarbeiterin;2635;Sozialarbeiterin;1;"The job description exactly matches ""Sozialarbeiterin"". There is a 100% similarity, meaning the description and this job title are identical in terms of duties and profession.";2635;Sozialarbeiter;0.9;"""Sozialarbeiter"" is the gender-neutral or masculine form of the same job title. The roles and responsibilities are the same, the only difference is gender-specific wording, making it highly relevant.";2635;Sozialpädagogin;0.7;"""Sozialpädagogin"" (female social pedagogue) is a closely related field with significant overlap in duties, clients, and settings. While not strictly identical, many responsibilities and contexts intersect, especially in social services. Thus, it is an appropriate third choice, though with somewhat lower confidence compared to the first two options."
67;no;Physiotherapeutin;2264;Physiotherapeut;0.98;"The job description ""Physiotherapeutin"" refers directly and unambiguously to the occupation of physiotherapist, with the feminine form in German. The top similarity match (77.6%) is ""Physiotherapeut"" (ISCO 2264), clearly corresponding to the intended role. ISCO 2264 is specifically for physiotherapists, making this the most accurate and appropriate title.";2264;Physiotherapeuten;0.92;"""Physiotherapeuten"" is the plural form of physiotherapist. Given the strong similarity (57.1%), and as many classification systems default to the masculine or plural form for general descriptors, this is also highly appropriate. The only difference is plurality and does not alter the primary occupational classification.";2264;PHYSIOTHERAPEUT;0.88;"""PHYSIOTHERAPEUT"" (in capital letters) is another variant of the same core job title with a similarity score of 46.0%. Although the uppercase makes no occupational difference, it is still used in some classification data and is among the closest matches listed. The ISCO code remains 2264, and the meaning is the same, just in an alternate stylization."
79;yes;Ingenieur;2100;Ingenieur;1.0;"The provided job description is ""Ingenieur"", which matches exactly with the first context example (ISCO 2100, Ingenieur, Similarity: 100%). This is clearly the primary and most suitable job title.";2100;INGENEUR;0.85;The second context match (ISCO 2100, INGENEUR, Similarity: 64.7%) is a variant spelling (numerous databases capitalize job titles), but it refers to the same occupational group of engineers. Thus, it’s very relevant, though less than the exact match.;2100;Ingenieurin;0.75;The third closest match (ISCO 2100, Ingenieurin, Similarity: 55.9%) is the feminine form of the job title. Given that the description is gender neutral/plural and commonly used, this is also a suitable selection.
85;yes;Medizinische Fachangestellte;3256;Medizinische Fachangestellte;1;"The job description exactly matches this title. All three main comparison cases (with the highest similarity) reference ""Medizinische Fachangestellte"" under ISCO 3256, confirming a perfect match.";3256;medizinischer Fachangestellter;0.95;"This is the male gender variant of the same profession. The duties, tasks, and required qualifications are identical. The only difference is gendered language; this is very common in German occupational nomenclature. High similarity and direct relevance make this an appropriate alternative.";3251;Zahnmedizinische Fachangestellte;0.65;"Although this is a specialization (dental medical assistant), the structure and many responsibilities overlap with ""Medizinische Fachangestellte"". It appears in the context as having some notable similarity, suggesting that it could be appropriate in broader generalization or in contexts where medical assistant experience is considered transferable. However, it is less precise than the first two options due to the dental focus."
